    <p id="parrafo">Have I told you about the Horadrim? They were an ancient confederation of mage-clans who sought to
        bind the three Prime Evils for eternity. The Horadrim are now nearly forgotten... and it appears that the bonds
        they wove are unraveling! As the last of the Horadrim, I pray that I can help you remedy their failure.</p>
